#  Aviation Accident Analysis Dashboard

##  Project Overview

This project presents an interactive **Aviation Accident Analysis Dashboard** designed to explore historical aviation accident data and uncover key safety insights. The dashboard enables stakeholders to monitor accident trends, injury severity, airport risk hotspots, aircraft damage levels, and accident phases to support aviation safety improvements.

---

##  Objectives

* Analyze total aviation accidents and injury severity distribution
* Identify top accident-prone airport locations
* Track yearly accident trends
* Examine aircraft damage categories
* Understand accident causes by flight purpose and flight phase

---

##  Key KPIs

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies


* **Microsoft Excel** – Data cleaning, transformation, pivot tables, slicers, KPI calculations, and dashboard creation

---

##  Insights Generated

* Landing and Takeoff phases account for the highest accident volume.
* Personal and Instructional flights contribute the majority of incidents.
* Anchorage (AK) and Miami (FL) are top accident-prone airports.
* Accident frequency shows a gradual decline over recent years.
